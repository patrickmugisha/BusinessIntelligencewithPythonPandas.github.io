# Business Intelligence with Python Pandas

This project uses data collected of all bird strikes around the country until the hudson river incident. It involves extracting valuable intelligence from data using data visualization, pivot tables, statistical analysis, Advanced BI, and other techniques.

This project was inspired by the US Airways Flight 1549 when it struck a flock of birds shortly after take-off, losing all engine power. The plane safely made an emergency landing over the Hudson River with no casualties.
